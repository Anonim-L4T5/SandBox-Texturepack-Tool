realistic.png is an example. To try it out type in command prompt "npm test".
Indexes are the numbers that are on top of the material you want to change in indexes.png/.xcf. They shouldn't change in bugfix versions, but they will change (along with offsets) when some texture is added.
In future versions I will add the option to replace textures that aren't 128x128.

Darkness awaits. What will you do? Your choice.
