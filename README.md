How to install:
Click on the green button with the label "Code" and click "Download ZIP". Then extract all the files to your sand:box instalation folder.

How to use:
Look at how is formatted the example pack (with "realistic.png" and write in command prompt "npm test" to create the example pack)
Double click on the file "create_texture_pack.bat" and follow instructions.
Indexes are shown in indexes.png/.xcf.
This creates a separate executable file. To update your texturepack to a newer version of sand:box, rerun the program.

Note:
This is for Windows only. Sorry linux users.
Right now this supports only changing material icons, however additional functionality will be added in the future.
This might break if new materials will be added (Indexes will be off, offsets might be in wrong places) and it will break if some other new textures will be added near material sprites (either offsets will be incorrect or it will break completely).

Darkness awaits. What will you do? Your choice.
